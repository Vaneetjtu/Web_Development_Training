1. Element Selector: It is used to select elements based on the element
e.g p{ } It is a paragraph Selector.
Id Selector: It is used to select an element based on id and id is unique 
so it is used to select one unique element e.g #id1{ }.
Class Selector: It is used to select an element based on class but the 
difference is it can select multiple elements as class name is not unique.
e.g .class1{ }
Universal Selector: It will select every HTML element e.g *{ }.
