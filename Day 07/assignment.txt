1. setInterval(): It calls a function at specified intervals in milliseconds until clearInterval() is not called 
or window is not closed e.g setInterval(hello(),1000) Now for every 1000 milliseconds Hello will be printed.
   setTimeout(): It calls a function after a number of milliseconds but it will only excecute once. 
   e.g setTimeout(hello(),2000) Now it will print Hello after 2 seconds of excecution but will not repeat.

2. It is used to prevent blocking as callback runs asynchronously which means no blocking 
or we use to bind something to an event handler.
